Lab 2: Simple Data Path

------------------------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, the user can store values inputted from a keypad into multiple registers, and perform bitwise right rotations on these numbers.
The focus of this lab is to reinforce the understanding of registers, flip flops, muxes, and ALUs.

FILES

-
Lab2.lgi

The only file in the folder is the Lab2.lgi file which opens the MML program where the lab is created with the given template.

------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS

To run the simulation, open the Lab2.lgi file with MML, then click the play button in the menu bar.
First press Clear Registers to reset all values to 0, input a value in the keypad, choose the Write Register Address, then click Update to save the keypad input to the destination register.
To perform a bitwise right rotatation on a value's bits, turn on Store Select, select the value you want to rotate using Read Register 2 Address, select the number of rotations you want to perform using Read Register 1 Adress, select the Write Register Address to choose where to save the answer, then press Update Register.
