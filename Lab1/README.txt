Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
 
This lab was an introduction to using MML to make different circuits. I had familiarized myself with the interface as well as the material, making circuits with various types of gates and truth tables.
The only file in the folder is the .lgi file which opens the MML program where the lab is created with the given template.
To run the simulation, open the .lgi file with MML, then click the play button in the menu bar. The only controls you need to change are the 4 switches on the first page, which determines the output for all of the parts of the lab.
